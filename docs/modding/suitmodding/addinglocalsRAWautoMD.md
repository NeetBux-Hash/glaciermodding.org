# Localisation Overrides AUTORAW MD

In this section, we'll focus on changing the **suit name** and **description** in the game. 
You will need: 
- **GlacierKit**
- A mod folder with a **manifest file** 
:::note VS Code 
 Optionally install **Visual Studio code** to edit your manifest with this ***"schema"***
    ```json
     "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework/main/Mod%20Manager/src/lib/manifest-schema.json"
     ```
Paste that in your manifest and **Visual Studio Code** will then know what the manifest can and can't contain.

>It might seem overkill to install **Visual Studio Code** just for this tutorial, but youâ€™ll appreciate the cleaner interface and error-checking features as you continue modding. Skip this if you had no idea what you just read.
:::
---

In short, this is what you will do:

1. **Identify the suit** you want to modify by locating the appropriate ***LOCR file***.
2. **Find the ***string***** representing the suit's name and description.
3. **Convert the string** into a **decimal number** using **Text Tools** w/GlacierKit.
4. **Modify the manifest** by adding a **localisation override** for the new name and description.
5. **Save and deploy** your changes.
6. Learn how to **Advance search** to find any other text in-game. 
>(Advance search is not necessary for suits)

---

## 1. **LOCATE YOUR LOCR FILE** 
Start by opening your project/mod in **Glacierkit**. 
Select the blue button that says *Open project* and click on your mod folder. You should know where that is by now. 
### 1. Get your LOCR file
Almost all **localisation** (text on screen) for reward suits are in these templates seen as **HASH** lines:  
   - `004B8C5124A49543` for S3 suits,
   - `009F430D046716BE` for S2 suits,
   - `00985A1100E5EDDC` for S1 suits. 

### 2. Go to your LOCR file  
- Simply copy and paste one of the **HASH** lines where your suit is located inside the *game contents* tab on the search bar, then hit enter. 
- You should get a file tree ending in a single file called something like this `randomwords.sweetmenutext].pc_localized-textlist`. It has a language or translation icon. 
- Open it by clicking on it.
>This is called a **LOCR file**. This one holds the names and descriptions of suits.

### 3. Confirm your LOCR file
You will see a *Preview* text box with code on the right and some additional info about the file you clicked on top. Confirm itâ€™s a **LOCR file** and take note of the ***HASH*** code beside it. We will need it for later.

:::info LOCR files
To speed up the process of finding the names and descriptions of suits, I have given their files for now.  
Later I will explain how to locate any *other text in-game* in the **advanced search** section.  
>After reading that, you will never struggle looking for *any other text* by finding their respective **LOCR files**.  
:::


---

## 2. GET YOUR STRING

The textbox you see holds every name and description of suits from a single season of the game.
 Every line of code in the text box consists of a 
 - **string** attached to 
 - the actual **text you see in-game**. 
 
 *Scroll it, and see what's inside.*

### 1. Find your Suit
  To find the Suit name you want to modify, click inside of the textbox with your mouse and hit `Ctrl + F` on your keyboard to start search mode. Look up your suit (example: blood money). 

You'll notice that every suit and description is attached to a **string** at the start
 
 Example:
 ```json
 "989928F2-06D6-42F3-871A-353F07DEF969_LEGACY_HERO_BLOODMONEYSUIT_M_HPA2293_NAME_": "Blood Money Suit"
 ```
 - The **string** is: `989928F2-06D6-42F3-871A-353F07DEF969_LEGACY_HERO_BLOODMONEYSUIT_M_HPA2293_NAME_`
 - and the **text you see in-game** is: `Blood Money Suit`

### 2. Copy the string
Looking further, you will also see your suit in multiple arrays in different languages. But the **string** of specifically your suit' name is the same in each language array!  
   - Example in English:
     ```json
     "989928F2-06D6-42F3-871A-353F07DEF969_LEGACY_HERO_BLOODMONEYSUIT_M_HPA2293_NAME_": "Blood Money Suit"
     ```
   - And in German:
     ```json
     "989928F2-06D6-42F3-871A-353F07DEF969_LEGACY_HERO_BLOODMONEYSUIT_M_HPA2293_NAME_": "Blood-Money-Anzug"
     ``` 

All we need is the long **string** inside the quotation marks.  
So copy it like so:
```json
989928F2-06D6-42F3-871A-353F07DEF969_LEGACY_HERO_BLOODMONEYSUIT_M_HPA2293_NAME_
``` 

:::warning Search Mode
If you start search mode without clicking the textbox, you will look for letters anywhere else in the program except for the box of code where your suit's name is.
:::
---

## 3. CONVERT TO DECIMAL
We first have to convert our **string** into a ***decimal*** before we can use it in the manifest later. That's what the **Text Tools** tab is for.


### 1. Go to Text Tools 
- Go to the *Text Tools* tab on the left
- Look for the **"Localisation hash calculator"** box. 
>Here you will convert your **string** and get two converted codes below it.
### 2. Convert your string
- Paste your **string** inside the box that says *Localisation hash calculator*
>It now produced *a hex* and a **decimal** form (meaning numbers-only) of your **string**
### 3. Get your decimal
- Copy **only** the converted **decimal number** which is below the *hex*. 
:::tip clipboard
We have all we need for the next step:
 - a **decimal number** from a **string**
 - the **HASH** from the **LOCR file** where we will alter the text

To keep track of copied code without going back every time for each individual copied code, let's use **Windows clipboard**.

To do so, 
- click the **windows button + V** and you should see a new window appear.
- Now copy both your LOCR **HASH** and **decimal** they will appear right below each other.
- You can close **Windows clipboard** and open it again with the same shortcut. The copied code won't dissapear

>It seems overkill for 2 lines of codes but it'll pay off and it beats using notepad ðŸ’€

## 4. UPDATE MANIFEST
Here we will be adding a **Localisation Override** line to your manifest. It will contain:
- **HASH** of your LOCR file
- **decimal** form of your **string**
- *Your new text*


### 1. Add the localisation override line 
Open your manifest and add the line by:


- Either 
    - copying: `"localisationOverrides": {}` and 
    - pasting it in your manifest
- Or
    - manually start typing it in starting with `"` and then continue typing
    - navigate the *suggestions menu* to find `localisationOverrides`.
    - and hit enter or click it with your mouse to get the result below

   ```json
   "localisationOverrides": {}
   ```
:::info "suggestions"
The suggestions function is only supported in **GlacierKit** or in **VS Code** with a ***schema***.
:::


### 2. Add your LOCR HASH 
- Go inside the `{}` and hit enter
- add the **HASH** from the **LOCR file** to it in quotation marks
- add a `:` after that and then another `{}`.
Result:

   ```json
   "localisationOverrides": {
       "yourLOCRhash": {}
   }
    ```

### 3. Set your language

Now go inside that bracket and specify a **language you want to overwrite**. Letâ€™s use English. 

   So type: 
   - `"english"` in quotation marks 
   - add a `:` 
   - add yet another `{}` bracket. This is the last one.

   Your result:
   ```json
   "localisationOverrides": {
       "yourLOCRhash": {
           "english": {}
       }
   }
   ```


### 4. Add your decimal


Now go inside those brackets and **add your converted decimal** in quotation marks with a `:`. 
```json
"localisationOverrides": {
    "yourLOCRhash": {
        "english": {
            "yourconvertednamedecimal": 
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Place your new text
After your **decimal**, you can place any text you want to be reflected in the game but it has to be in quotes

```json
"localisationOverrides": {
    "yourLOCRhash": {
        "english": {
            "yourconvertednamedecimal": "New Suit Name"
        }
    }
}
````

Now try the same for the description as well.

To add **another string** from the **same LOCR** file:
- add a comma and hit enter
- **convert the string** for the descrption
- add your **newly converted decimal** 

Example:
```json
"localisationOverrides": {
        "yourLocrHASH": {
            "english": {
                "yourconverteddecimal": "New Suit Name",
                "yourotherconverteddecimal": "New Suit Description/or Other New Suit name"
            }
        }
    }
```
:::info Structure
>If you're on track, you should have noticed that the *LocalisationOverrides* code in the manifest is set up just like our **LOCR file** where we got the strings from using the exact same coding grammar(what do i call that)
    
    *Even better if you have also have noticed how similar this method is to the previous ***blobs*** article.*
:::

### 6. Save & Deploy!
Click the little save icon (it's a floppy disk) on top or click **ctrl+S** on your keyboard. Deploy your mod in **SMF** and your new suit name and description will appear in place of the default one.

:::success
*Looking good, man!* 

Youâ€™ve successfully replaced the suit name and description in the game with your own custom text. Now, when you load up the game, your new text will appear in place of the default one. 
>Don't close **GlacierKit** just yet if you already are moving on to the next topic below.

## More on LocalisationOverrides

### Adding More Languages

To add more language support for your new suit, simply:
- add a comma after your english bracket 
- add another language bracket holding the **same decimal** of your string.

```json
"localisationOverrides": {
        "yourLocrHASH": {
            "english": {
                "yourconverteddecimal": "New Suit Name",
                "yourotherconverteddecimal": "New Suit Description/or Other New Suit name"
            },
            "french": {
                "yourconverteddecimal": "Niveua Costume nome",
                "yourotherconverteddecimal": "Le costume de l'argent du sang mais avec un style supplÃ©mentaire. Aucune autre combinaison ne peut rivaliser avec celle-ci"
            }
        }
    }
```
:::info Same STRINGS
No need to convert any strings again either since theyâ€™re the same in each `{array}`, remember? Unless you add **new suit names or descriptions** with **different strings** attached to them, you will have to **convert those to decimal again** and just add them inside your **current LOCR array**. 
>If you didn't understand this sentence, you were not paying attention and expected this tutorial to do everything for you. Not looking good, man!  
:::
---
### Adding more LOCR files
If you want to make changes to another LOCR file too, just do the same as you did with the language bracket: 
- add a comma after your previous **LOCR bracket** 
- Repeat the steps with your **new LOCR file**
- Repeat the **string** conversion to get **new decimals**

example:
```json
"localisationOverrides": {
        "yourLocrHASH": {
            "english": {
                "yourconverteddecimal": "New Suit Name",
                "yourotherconverteddecimal": "New Suit Description/or Other New Suit name"
            }
        },
        "otherLocrHASH": {
            "english": {
                "somenewconverteddecimal": "More New Suit Name",
                "someotherconverteddecimal": "More New Suit Description/or Other More New Suit name"
            },
            "spanish": {
                "somenewconverteddecimal": "MÃ¡s nombre de traje nuevo",
                "someotherconverteddecimal": "MÃ¡s descripciÃ³n del traje nuevo/u otro nombre del traje mÃ¡s nuevo"
            }
        }
    }
```
:::note language codes
- The reason why "spanish" is used here and not "EspaÃ±ol" is because the manifest schema is coded in English. 
- As for why it doesn't use the same language codes as the actual **LOCR files**, i have no clue either. To see how all languages have to be written down in the manifest, see the **manifest info in SMF**. 
>It's the book icon on the left after enabling developer mode. This info will be hammered in, many times.

Let's take a look at a manifest from a mod that has covered every angle of this article for a proper example of everything this article has covered.
To close this article and see every technique applied here, lets take an example of another mod's manifest that has covered every single aspect of this article:


INSERT BIG MANIFESTO HERE

Now to test this with any text in this 
---

If the text you are looking for isnâ€™t there (warning, advanced searches are Case sensitive), go to the next article. It's a very short one.  

Let's find the text we want to modify by looking up the words used in the text we want replaced. Open GlacierKit and click on "Advanced search" on the left. Itâ€™s a magnifying icon. Enable only chunk0. Thatâ€™s where the suits are and so is the text usually. No need to look over the whole game. Only select chunk0 and the checkbox "localisation". Type what needs to be replaced. Example: "blood money" is wrong and will only give us a single dialogue line from some random conversation. I have to look up "Blood Money". You can search multiple times. You can see that in the bar below where itâ€™s doing a search task. Type in as many as you want. This might take a while, hence why we only search in one chunk.  
If search is done, it's important you need a LOCR file. Find your text inside the same way and follow along from there
